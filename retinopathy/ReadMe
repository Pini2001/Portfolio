The purpose of this study is to develop a machine learning model that, from color fundus images, can determine if the patient has diabetic rethinopathy (DR).

This model can become a valuable tool for hospitals or ophthalmology clinics that do not have the necessary resources for diagnosis, as well as for people with DR who do not have the financial means to undergo these diagnostic tests.
The application of this model can help prevent the spread of DR by reducing the number of complications or barriers that favor its dissemination. In addition, the increasing incidence of DR means that it is projected to be one of the main causes of visual impairment or blindness in the future.
In this context, the implementation of machine learning models will not only help alleviate the workload of ophthalmologists, but will also reduce the time and costs of detecting and treating the disease.
It will also improve diagnostic accuracy, as it will allow the specialist to compare his own diagnosis with the result obtained by the tool, significantly reducing the margin of error.

In this context, both traditional ML techniques and innovative Deep Learning (DL) techniques for medical image processing can be applied to build diagnostic prediction models.
In particular, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are already successfully used in medical image processing for tasks such as disease detection, diagnosis and classification.
In this study, predictive models will be developed around the three algorithms in order to compare them and to identify the most suitable technique.
